  spec.description  = <<-DESC
Since SwiftUI is still relatively new, there are many use-cases that are not addressed either directly by Apple or by the community in general. PureSwiftUITools is a way of formulating various ideas into tools which can be used directly in projects, or used as a basis for learning, extending for bespoke purposes, or as a foundation for building a more robust approach. I see this package as a educational platform as much as anything else. As various utilities are introduced they will be accompanied by appropriate demos and gists that demonstrate usage.
